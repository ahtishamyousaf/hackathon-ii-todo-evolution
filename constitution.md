# Todo Console App - Phase I Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code must be generated by Claude Code from specifications. Manual code writing is prohibited.

**Workflow**:
- Write clear, detailed specifications first
- Use Claude Code to generate implementation
- Test the generated code
- If issues arise, refine the specification and regenerate
- Never manually edit generated code

**Rationale**: This hackathon demonstrates spec-driven development mastery. The quality of specifications directly determines the quality of the implementation.

### II. Simplicity and Focus
Phase I is intentionally minimal to establish a solid foundation.

**In Scope**:
- Console-based interface only
- In-memory storage (Python list/dict)
- 5 basic CRUD features
- Clean, readable code structure

**Out of Scope**:
- No database persistence (comes in Phase II)
- No web interface (comes in Phase II)
- No AI/chatbot features (comes in Phase III)
- No intermediate or advanced features (comes in Phase V)
- No deployment considerations (comes in Phase IV/V)

**Rationale**: Each phase builds on the previous. Phase I success = strong foundation for all future phases.

### III. Clean Code Standards
All generated code must follow Python best practices.

**Requirements**:
- Type hints for all function parameters and return values
- PEP 8 style guide compliance
- Dataclasses for data models
- Clear separation of concerns (models, business logic, UI)
- Descriptive variable and function names
- No magic numbers or hardcoded values
- Comprehensive error handling
- Input validation on all user inputs

**Rationale**: Clean code is maintainable code. Phases II-V will extend this codebase.

### IV. User Experience Excellence
The CLI interface must be intuitive and helpful.

**Requirements**:
- Clear, numbered menu with all available options
- Helpful error messages that guide the user
- Confirmation messages for all actions
- Well-formatted output (aligned, readable task lists)
- Status indicators (✓ Complete / ○ Pending)
- Graceful exit option
- Input prompts that clearly state what's expected

**Rationale**: Good UX demonstrates attention to detail and professionalism.

### V. Testability by Design
The application structure must enable easy testing.

**Architecture Requirements**:
- Business logic separated from UI (TaskManager class)
- Pure functions where possible (no side effects)
- Clear input/output contracts
- Dependency injection for storage
- Each feature implementable and testable independently

**Rationale**: While formal tests aren't required in Phase I, the architecture must support testing for future phases.

### VI. Feature Boundaries
Phase I implements exactly 5 basic features - no more, no less.

**The 5 Features**:
1. **Add Task**: Create new todo with title and optional description
2. **View Task List**: Display all tasks with status and metadata
3. **Update Task**: Modify title/description of existing task
4. **Delete Task**: Remove task from the list
5. **Mark as Complete**: Toggle task completion status

**Feature Completeness Criteria**:
- Each feature has its own specification document
- Each feature handles errors gracefully
- Each feature provides user feedback
- Each feature validates inputs
- Each feature works correctly with in-memory storage

**Rationale**: Focused scope ensures quality over quantity. Bonus features come later.

## Technical Standards

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.13+ (or 3.12 minimum)
- **Package Manager**: UV (modern, fast pip replacement)
- **Storage**: In-memory (Python list/dict structures)
- **Interface**: Command-line (input/print)
- **Data Model**: Python dataclass for Task entity
- **ID Generation**: Auto-incrementing integer

### Data Model Requirements

**Task Entity**:
```python
@dataclass
class Task:
    id: int                    # Unique identifier
    title: str                 # Required, non-empty
    description: str           # Optional, can be empty
    completed: bool            # Status flag
    created_at: datetime       # Auto-set on creation
    updated_at: datetime       # Auto-update on modification
```

### Error Handling Standards

**All features must handle**:
- Invalid task IDs (non-existent)
- Empty or invalid inputs
- Type errors (non-numeric IDs)
- Out-of-range operations

**Error Response Format**:
- Clear message explaining what went wrong
- Guidance on how to correct the error
- Return to main menu (no crashes)

## Governance

### Constitutional Authority
This constitution supersedes all other development practices and preferences. When in doubt, refer to this document.

### Spec-First Workflow (Mandatory)
1. **Write Specification**: Document the feature/change in specs/
2. **Review Specification**: Ensure clarity and completeness
3. **Generate Code**: Use Claude Code with specification
4. **Test Implementation**: Verify all acceptance criteria
5. **Refine Specification**: If issues found, update spec and regenerate
6. **Never Edit Code Manually**: Always improve through specification refinement

### Quality Gates
- **Before Code Generation**: Specification must be complete and approved
- **After Code Generation**: All acceptance criteria must pass
- **Before Submission**: All quality criteria checkboxes must be checked

### Amendment Process
- Constitution changes require documentation of rationale
- Version number must be incremented
- Last amended date must be updated
- Changes must maintain Phase I scope boundaries

### Phase Transition Principles
- Phase I code is the foundation for Phase II
- Architecture must be extensible for database integration
- Business logic must be reusable for web API
- Design decisions should consider future phases
