## Prompt

yes lets create the constitution for phase 1

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive constitution.md for Phase I of Hackathon II - "Todo Console App".

The constitution establishes six core principles:

1. **Spec-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: All code must be generated by Claude Code from specifications. Manual code writing is prohibited. Workflow: Write specs → Generate with Claude Code → Test → Refine specs if needed → Regenerate.

2. **Simplicity and Focus**: Phase I is intentionally minimal with console interface, in-memory storage, and only 5 basic CRUD features. Explicitly excludes database, web UI, AI features, and deployment (those come in later phases).

3. **Clean Code Standards**: Python best practices including type hints, PEP 8, dataclasses, separation of concerns, descriptive naming, no magic numbers, comprehensive error handling, and input validation.

4. **User Experience Excellence**: Intuitive CLI with clear menus, helpful error messages, confirmation feedback, well-formatted output, status indicators, and graceful exit.

5. **Testability by Design**: Architecture separates business logic from UI, uses pure functions, clear contracts, dependency injection, and supports independent feature testing.

6. **Feature Boundaries**: Exactly 5 features - Add Task, View Task List, Update Task, Delete Task, Mark as Complete. Each feature has completeness criteria.

Technical standards defined:
- Stack: Python 3.13+, UV package manager, in-memory storage, dataclass-based Task model
- Project structure: constitution.md, specs/ folder, src/ folder, CLAUDE.md, README.md
- Data model: Task entity with id, title, description, completed, created_at, updated_at
- Error handling: Invalid IDs, empty inputs, type errors, clear error messages

Quality criteria established:
- Specification quality (8 checkboxes)
- Generated code quality (8 checkboxes)
- Functional quality (8 checkboxes)
- Documentation quality (6 checkboxes)

Governance model:
- Constitution supersedes all other practices
- Spec-first workflow is mandatory (6-step process)
- Quality gates at specification, generation, and submission stages
- Amendment process requires documentation and versioning
- Phase transition principles for extensibility

Version: 1.0.0 | Ratified: 2025-12-10 | Phase: I - Console Application

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Foundation document created that governs all Phase I development. Establishes mandatory spec-driven workflow and quality standards.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests applicable (documentation artifact)
- 📁 Files: Created constitution.md (300+ lines) defining 6 principles, technical standards, quality criteria, and governance
- 🔁 Next prompts: Write specs/overview.md, specs/architecture.md, then individual feature specifications (01-add-task.md through 05-mark-complete.md)
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully balances Phase I simplicity with forward-looking architecture for Phases II-V. Clear boundaries prevent scope creep while ensuring extensibility.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual review - PASS (comprehensive, follows template structure, addresses all Phase I requirements)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A - direct request
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin specification writing with overview.md to describe project purpose and scope at high level
